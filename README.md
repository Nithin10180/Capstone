🌾 About the Capstone Project
AI-Based Crop Recommendation System
This capstone project focuses on the development of an AI-Based Crop Recommendation System that assists farmers and agricultural stakeholders in selecting the most suitable crop based on soil nutrients and environmental conditions. The project applies machine learning and data-driven techniques to improve agricultural productivity, sustainability, and decision-making.
Traditional crop selection methods rely heavily on experience, manual soil testing, and generalized advisory systems, which often fail to consider the complex interactions between soil properties and climatic factors. This project addresses these limitations by leveraging artificial intelligence to provide accurate, data-driven crop recommendations.

🎯 Objectives of the Capstone Project
•	To recommend the most suitable crop based on soil and weather parameters
•	To analyze the impact of soil nutrients (N, P, K) and environmental factors on crop growth
•	To compare machine learning and deep learning models for crop recommendation
•	To build a scalable and farmer-friendly intelligent advisory system
•	To support sustainable agriculture and food security

🧠 Methodology & System Workflow
The project follows a structured end-to-end machine learning pipeline:
1.	Dataset Collection & Preprocessing
o	A crop recommendation dataset containing parameters such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), pH, temperature, humidity, and rainfall is used
o	Data cleaning is performed to handle missing values and outliers
o	Feature scaling and label encoding are applied to prepare the data for model training
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
o	Statistical analysis and visualizations are used to understand feature distributions
o	Relationships between soil parameters and crop types are analyzed
3.	Model Development
Multiple machine learning and deep learning models are implemented and compared, including:
o	Logistic Regression
o	Random Forest Classifier
o	Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network
o	Attention-based models (e.g., TabNet for tabular data)
4.	Model Training & Evaluation
o	The dataset is split into training and testing sets
o	Models are evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
o	Performance comparison highlights the effectiveness of classical ML vs deep learning models
5.	Prediction & Recommendation
o	The trained model predicts the most suitable crop for given soil and climate conditions
o	Output recommendations are interpretable and farmer-friendly
